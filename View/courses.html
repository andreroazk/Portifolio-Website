            <p id="essentials">
                The essentials of computer software, hardware, and laptop management
                form the foundation for building further technical programming skills.
                Learn to configure your laptop environment, basic PC and troubleshoot
                problems. Students create backups, install virus protection, and
                manage files through a basic understanding of the Windows Operating
                System. Students also install and configure the Windows Operating
                System, and a virtual machine environment and explore computer
                organization including basic numerical systems, functional hardware
                and software components needed to run programs.

            <p id="programming">
                Possessing the fundamentals of logic, problem-solving and programming
                language structure provides a solid foundation for further study in
                the field. Students develop introductory knowledge of computer
                programming with emphasis on problem analysis and design, using
                algorithms, pseudocode, flowcharts, UML Class Diagrams and testing,
                with the Java programming language used as a means to implement
                problem solution designs. Through an introduction to the Java
                programming language students use sequential structures, selection
                structures, repetition structures, variables, constants, methods,
                constructors, one-dimensional arrays, object-oriented programming,
                classes, objects, abstraction, encapsulation, inputs, outputs, coding
                conventions and documentation. Theory is reinforced with application
                by means of practical laboratory assessments.

            <p id="database">
                Databases are used to store data and are a core component of many
                information technology systems. Students learn the fundamentals of
                relational databases design using Entity Relation Diagrams (ERDs), and
                use Structured Query Language (SQL) to create, modify and query a
                database. Students design and create databases that are maintainable,
                secure and adaptable to change in business requirements, using
                normalization. Students become familiar with the functions of a
                Database Management System (DBMS) and its components in comparison
                with legacy systems and alternative information storage mechanisms.

                significant opportunities, but it also creates potential hazards and
                ethical problems that demand responsible solutions. Students explore
                the possibilities ahead, assess their own aptitudes and strengths,
                and apply critical thinking and decision-making tools to help
                resolve some of the important issues in our complex society with its
                competing interests.

            <p id="communication">
                Communication remains an essential skill sought by employers,
                regardless of discipline or field of study. Using a practical,
                vocation-oriented approach, students focus on meeting the
                requirements of effective communication. Through a combination of
                lectures, exercises, and independent learning, students practise
                writing, speaking, reading, listening, locating and documenting
                information and using technology to communicate professionally.
                Students develop and strengthen communication skills that contribute
                to success in both educational and workplace environments.
